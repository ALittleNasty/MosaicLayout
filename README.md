# MosaicLayout
I'm working on a new layout for iOS, very similar to [MosaicUI](https://github.com/betzerra/MosaicUI).

This time I'm using the **Lightbox algorithm** described in @vjeux's blog and taking advantage of **UICollectionView**.  

I'm not fully satisfied with the implementation and the code itself yet but I hope polishing it in the next weeks.
