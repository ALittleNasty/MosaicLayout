# MosaicLayout
A layout very similar to [MosaicUI](https://github.com/betzerra/MosaicUI) that uses **Lightbox algorithm** described in @vjeux's blog and takes advantage of **UICollectionView**.

**VERY IMPORTANT STUFF:** Latest commits will be found in https://github.com/TwoTinedFork/MosaicLayout
I'll be maintaining this UI with @Chompas under the name of TwoTinedFork (https://github.com/TwoTinedFork/)
Thanks a lot for your support in MosaicLayout and MosaicUI

Sincerely, @betzerra
